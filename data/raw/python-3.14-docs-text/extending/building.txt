4. C와 C++ 확장 빌드하기
************************

A C extension for CPython is a shared library (for example, a ".so"
file on Linux, ".pyd" on Windows), which exports an *initialization
function*.

See Defining extension modules for details.


4.1. setuptools로 C와 C++ 확장 빌드하기
=======================================

Building, packaging and distributing extension modules is best done
with third-party tools, and is out of scope of this document. One
suitable tool is Setuptools, whose documentation can be found at
https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/setuptools.html.

The "distutils" module, which was included in the standard library
until Python 3.12, is now maintained as part of Setuptools.
