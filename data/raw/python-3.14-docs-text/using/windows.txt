4. 윈도우에서 파이썬 사용하기
*****************************

이 문서는 Microsoft 윈도우에서 파이썬을 사용할 때 알아야 할 윈도우 특
정 동작에 대한 개요를 제공하는 것을 목표로 합니다.

Unlike most Unix systems and services, Windows does not include a
system supported installation of Python. Instead, Python can be
obtained from a number of distributors, including directly from the
CPython team. Each Python distribution will have its own benefits and
drawbacks, however, consistency with other tools you are using is
generally a worthwhile benefit. Before committing to the process
described here, we recommend investigating your existing tools to see
if they can provide Python directly.

To obtain Python from the CPython team, use the Python Install
Manager. This is a standalone tool that makes Python available as
global commands on your Windows machine, integrates with the system,
and supports updates over time. You can download the Python Install
Manager from python.org/downloads or through the Microsoft Store app.

Once you have installed the Python Install Manager, the global
"python" command can be used from any terminal to launch your current
latest version of Python. This version may change over time as you add
or remove different versions, and the "py list" command will show
which is current.

In general, we recommend that you create a virtual environment for
each project and run "<env>\Scripts\Activate" in your terminal to use
it. This provides isolation between projects, consistency over time,
and ensures that additional commands added by packages are also
available in your session. Create a virtual environment using "python
-m venv <env path>".

If the "python" or "py" commands do not seem to be working, please see
the Troubleshooting section below. There are sometimes additional
manual steps required to configure your PC.

Apart from using the Python install manager, Python can also be
obtained as NuGet packages. See nuget.org 패키지 below for more
information on these packages.

The embeddable distros are minimal packages of Python suitable for
embedding into larger applications. They can be installed using the
Python install manager. See 내장 가능한 패키지 below for more
information on these packages.


4.1. Python install manager
===========================


4.1.1. Installation
-------------------

The Python install manager can be installed from the Microsoft Store
app or downloaded and installed from python.org/downloads. The two
versions are identical.

To install through the Store, simply click "Install". After it has
completed, open a terminal and type "python" to get started.

To install the file downloaded from python.org, either double-click
and select "Install", or run "Add-AppxPackage <path to MSIX>" in
Windows Powershell.

After installation, the "python", "py", and "pymanager" commands
should be available. If you have existing installations of Python, or
you have modified your "PATH" variable, you may need to remove them or
undo the modifications. See Troubleshooting for more help with fixing
non-working commands.

When you first install a runtime, you will likely be prompted to add a
directory to your "PATH". This is optional, if you prefer to use the
"py" command, but is offered for those who prefer the full range of
aliases (such as "python3.14.exe") to be available. The directory will
be "%LocalAppData%\Python\bin" by default, but may be customized by an
administrator. Click Start and search for "Edit environment variables
for your account" for the system settings page to add the path.

Each Python runtime you install will have its own directory for
scripts. These also need to be added to "PATH" if you want to use
them.

The Python install manager will be automatically updated to new
releases. This does not affect any installs of Python runtimes.
Uninstalling the Python install manager does not uninstall any Python
runtimes.

If you are not able to install an MSIX in your context, for example,
you are using automated deployment software that does not support it,
or are targeting Windows Server 2019, please see Advanced installation
below for more information.


4.1.2. Basic use
----------------

The recommended command for launching Python is "python", which will
either launch the version requested by the script being launched, an
active virtual environment, or the default installed version, which
will be the latest stable release unless configured otherwise. If no
version is specifically requested and no runtimes are installed at
all, the current latest release will be installed automatically.

For all scenarios involving multiple runtime versions, the recommended
command is "py". This may be used anywhere in place of "python" or the
older "py.exe" launcher. By default, "py" matches the behaviour of
"python", but also allows command line options to select a specific
version as well as subcommands to manage installations. These are
detailed below.

Because the "py" command may already be taken by the previous version,
there is also an unambiguous "pymanager" command. Scripted installs
that are intending to use Python install manager should consider using
"pymanager", due to the lower chance of encountering a conflict with
existing installs. The only difference between the two commands is
when running without any arguments: "py" will install and launch your
default interpreter, while "pymanager" will display help ("pymanager
exec ..." provides equivalent behaviour to "py ...").

Each of these commands also has a windowed version that avoids
creating a console window. These are "pyw", "pythonw" and
"pymanagerw". A "python3" command is also included that mimics the
"python" command. It is intended to catch accidental uses of the
typical POSIX command on Windows, but is not meant to be widely used
or recommended.

To launch your default runtime, run "python" or "py" with the
arguments you want to be passed to the runtime (such as script files
or the module to launch):

   $> py
   ...
   $> python my-script.py
   ...
   $> py -m this
   ...

The default runtime can be overridden with the
"PYTHON_MANAGER_DEFAULT" environment variable, or a configuration
file. See Configuration for information about configuration settings.

To launch a specific runtime, the "py" command accepts a "-V:<TAG>"
option. This option must be specified before any others. The tag is
part or all of the identifier for the runtime; for those from the
CPython team, it looks like the version, potentially with the
platform. For compatibility, the "V:" may be omitted in cases where
the tag refers to an official release and starts with "3".

   $> py -V:3.14 ...
   $> py -V:3-arm64 ...

Runtimes from other distributors may require the *company* to be
included as well. This should be separated from the tag by a slash,
and may be a prefix. Specifying the company is optional when it is
"PythonCore", and specifying the tag is optional (but not the slash)
when you want the latest release from a specific company.

   $> py -V:Distributor\1.0 ...
   $> py -V:distrib/ ...

If no version is specified, but a script file is passed, the script
will be inspected for a *shebang line*. This is a special format for
the first line in a file that allows overriding the command. See
Shebang lines for more information. When there is no shebang line, or
it cannot be resolved, the script will be launched with the default
runtime.

If you are running in an active virtual environment, have not
requested a particular version, and there is no shebang line, the
default runtime will be that virtual environment. In this scenario,
the "python" command was likely already overridden and none of these
checks occurred. However, this behaviour ensures that the "py" command
can be used interchangeably.

When you launch either "python" or "py" but do not have any runtimes
installed, and the requested version is the default, it will be
installed automatically and then launched. Otherwise, the requested
version will be installed if automatic installation is configured
(most likely by setting "PYTHON_MANAGER_AUTOMATIC_INSTALL" to "true"),
or if the "py exec" or "pymanager exec" forms of the command were
used.


4.1.3. Command help
-------------------

The "py help" command will display the full list of supported
commands, along with their options. Any command may be passed the "-?"
option to display its help, or its name passed to "py help".

   $> py help
   $> py help install
   $> py install /?

All commands support some common options, which will be shown by "py
help". These options must be specified after any subcommand.
Specifying "-v" or "--verbose" will increase the amount of output
shown, and "-vv" will increase it further for debugging purposes.
Passing "-q" or "--quiet" will reduce output, and "-qq" will reduce it
further.

The "--config=<PATH>" option allows specifying a configuration file to
override multiple settings at once. See Configuration below for more
information about these files.


4.1.4. Listing runtimes
-----------------------

   $> py list [-f=|--format=<FMT>] [-1|--one] [--online|-s=|--source=<URL>] [<TAG>...]

The list of installed runtimes can be seen using "py list". A filter
may be added in the form of one or more tags (with or without company
specifier), and each may include a "<", "<=", ">=" or ">" prefix to
restrict to a range.

A range of formats are supported, and can be passed as the "--
format=<FMT>" or "-f <FMT>" option. Formats include "table" (a user
friendly table view), "csv" (comma-separated table), "json" (a single
JSON blob), "jsonl" (one JSON blob per result), "exe" (just the
executable path), "prefix" (just the prefix path).

The "--one" or "-1" option only displays a single result. If the
default runtime is included, it will be the one. Otherwise, the "best"
result is shown ("best" is deliberately vaguely defined, but will
usually be the most recent version). The result shown by "py list
--one <TAG>" will match the runtime that would be launched by "py
-V:<TAG>".

The "--only-managed" option excludes results that were not installed
by the Python install manager. This is useful when determining which
runtimes may be updated or uninstalled through the "py" command.

The "--online" option is short for passing "--source=<URL>" with the
default source. Passing either of these options will search the online
index for runtimes that can be installed. The result shown by "py list
--online --one <TAG>" will match the runtime that would be installed
by "py install <TAG>".

   $> py list --online 3.14

For compatibility with the old launcher, the "--list", "--list-paths",
"-0" and "-0p" commands (e.g. "py -0p") are retained. They do not
allow additional options, and will produce legacy formatted output.


4.1.5. Installing runtimes
--------------------------

   $> py install [-s=|--source=<URL>] [-f|--force] [-u|--update] [--dry-run] [<TAG>...]

New runtime versions may be added using "py install". One or more tags
may be specified, and the special tag "default" may be used to select
the default. Ranges are not supported for installation.

The "--source=<URL>" option allows overriding the online index that is
used to obtain runtimes. This may be used with an offline index, as
shown in Offline installs.

Passing "--force" will ignore any cached files and remove any existing
install to replace it with the specified one.

Passing "--update" will replace existing installs if the new version
is newer. Otherwise, they will be left. If no tags are provided with "
--update", all installs managed by the Python install manager will be
updated if newer versions are available. Updates will remove any
modifications made to the install, including globally installed
packages, but virtual environments will continue to work.

Passing "--dry-run" will generate output and logs, but will not modify
any installs.

In addition to the above options, the "--target" option will extract
the runtime to the specified directory instead of doing a normal
install. This is useful for embedding runtimes into larger
applications. Unlike a normal install, "py" will not be aware of the
extracted runtime, and no Start menu or other shortcuts will be
created. To launch the runtime, directly execute the main executable
(typically "python.exe") in the target directory.

   $> py install ... [-t=|--target=<PATH>] <TAG>


4.1.6. Offline installs
-----------------------

To perform offline installs of Python, you will need to first create
an offline index on a machine that has network access.

   $> py install --download=<PATH> ... <TAG>...

The "--download=<PATH>" option will download the packages for the
listed tags and create a directory containing them and an "index.json"
file suitable for later installation. This entire directory can be
moved to the offline machine and used to install one or more of the
bundled runtimes:

   $> py install --source="<PATH>\index.json" <TAG>...

The Python install manager can be installed by downloading its
installer and moving it to another machine before installing.

Alternatively, the ZIP files in an offline index directory can simply
be transferred to another machine and extracted. This will not
register the install in any way, and so it must be launched by
directly referencing the executables in the extracted directory, but
it is sometimes a preferable approach in cases where installing the
Python install manager is not possible or convenient.

In this way, Python runtimes can be installed and managed on a machine
without access to the internet.


4.1.7. Uninstalling runtimes
----------------------------

   $> py uninstall [-y|--yes] <TAG>...

Runtimes may be removed using the "py uninstall" command. One or more
tags must be specified. Ranges are not supported here.

The "--yes" option bypasses the confirmation prompt before
uninstalling.

Instead of passing tags individually, the "--purge" option may be
specified. This will remove all runtimes managed by the Python install
manager, including cleaning up the Start menu, registry, and any
download caches. Runtimes that were not installed by the Python
install manager will not be impacted, and neither will manually
created configuration files.

   $> py uninstall [-y|--yes] --purge

The Python install manager can be uninstalled through the Windows
"Installed apps" settings page. This does not remove any runtimes, and
they will still be usable, though the global "python" and "py"
commands will be removed. Reinstalling the Python install manager will
allow you to manage these runtimes again. To completely clean up all
Python runtimes, run with "--purge" before uninstalling the Python
install manager.


4.1.8. Configuration
--------------------

Python install manager is configured with a hierarchy of configuration
files, environment variables, command-line options, and registry
settings. In general, configuration files have the ability to
configure everything, including the location of other configuration
files, while registry settings are administrator-only and will
override configuration files. Command-line options override all other
settings, but not every option is available.

This section will describe the defaults, but be aware that modified or
overridden installs may resolve settings differently.

A global configuration file may be configured by an administrator, and
would be read first. The user configuration file is stored at
"%AppData%\Python\pymanager.json" (note that this location is under
"Roaming", not "Local") and is read next, overwriting any settings
from earlier files. An additional configuration file may be specified
as the "PYTHON_MANAGER_CONFIG" environment variable or the "--config"
command line option (but not both). These locations may be modified by
administrative customization options listed later.

The following settings are those that are considered likely to be
modified in normal use. Later sections list those that are intended
for administrative customization.

+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+-----------------------------------+

Dotted names should be nested inside JSON objects, for example,
"list.format" would be specified as "{"list": {"format": "table"}}".


4.1.9. Shebang lines
--------------------

If the first line of a script file starts with "#!", it is known as a
"shebang" line.  Linux and other Unix like operating systems have
native support for such lines and they are commonly used on such
systems to indicate how a script should be executed. The "python" and
"py" commands allow the same facilities to be used with Python scripts
on Windows.

To allow shebang lines in Python scripts to be portable between Unix
and Windows, a number of 'virtual' commands are supported to specify
which interpreter to use.  The supported virtual commands are:

* "/usr/bin/env <ALIAS>"

* "/usr/bin/env -S <ALIAS>"

* "/usr/bin/<ALIAS>"

* "/usr/local/bin/<ALIAS>"

* "<ALIAS>"

예를 들어, 스크립트의 첫 번째 줄이 다음과 같이 시작하면

   #! /usr/bin/python

기본 파이썬이나 활성 가상 환경을 찾아서 사용합니다. 유닉스에서 작동하
도록 작성된 많은 파이썬 스크립트에는 이미 이 줄이 있어서, 수정하지 않
고도 이러한 스크립트를 런처에서 사용할 수 있습니다. 윈도우에서 유닉스
에서 유용할 새 스크립트를 작성하면, "/usr"로 시작하는 셔뱅 줄 중 하나
를 사용해야 합니다.

Any of the above virtual commands can have "<ALIAS>" replaced by an
alias from an installed runtime. That is, any command generated in the
global aliases directory (which you may have added to your "PATH"
environment variable) can be used in a shebang, even if it is not on
your "PATH". This allows the use of shebangs like
"/usr/bin/python3.12" to select a particular runtime.

If no runtimes are installed, or if automatic installation is enabled,
the requested runtime will be installed if necessary. See
Configuration for information about configuration settings.

The "/usr/bin/env" form of shebang line will also search the "PATH"
environment variable for unrecognized commands. This corresponds to
the behaviour of the Unix "env" program, which performs the same
search, but prefers launching known Python commands. A warning may be
displayed when searching for arbitrary executables, and this search
may be disabled by the "shebang_can_run_anything" configuration
option.

Shebang lines that do not match any of patterns are treated as
*Windows* executable paths that are absolute or relative to the
directory containing the script file. This is a convenience for
Windows-only scripts, such as those generated by an installer, since
the behavior is not compatible with Unix-style shells. These paths may
be quoted, and may include multiple arguments, after which the path to
the script and any additional arguments will be appended. This
functionality may be disabled by the "shebang_can_run_anything"
configuration option.

참고:

  The behaviour of shebangs in the Python install manager is subtly
  different from the previous "py.exe" launcher, and the old
  configuration options no longer apply. If you are specifically
  reliant on the old behaviour or configuration, we recommend
  installing the legacy launcher. The legacy launcher's "py" command
  will override PyManager's one by default, and you will need to use
  "pymanager" commands for installing and uninstalling.


4.1.10. Advanced installation
-----------------------------

For situations where an MSIX cannot be installed, such as some older
administrative distribution platforms, there is an MSI available from
the python.org downloads page. This MSI has no user interface, and can
only perform per-machine installs to its default location in Program
Files. It will attempt to modify the system "PATH" environment
variable to include this install location, but be sure to validate
this on your configuration.

참고:

  Windows Server 2019 is the only version of Windows that CPython
  supports that does not support MSIX. For Windows Server 2019, you
  should use the MSI.

Be aware that the MSI package does not bundle any runtimes, and so is
not suitable for installs into offline environments without also
creating an offline install index. See Offline installs and
Administrative configuration for information on handling these
scenarios.

Runtimes installed by the MSI are shared with those installed by the
MSIX, and are all per-user only. The Python install manager does not
support installing runtimes per-machine. To emulate a per-machine
install, you can use "py install --target=<shared location>" as
administrator and add your own system-wide modifications to "PATH",
the registry, or the Start menu.

When the MSIX is installed, but commands are not available in the
"PATH" environment variable, they can be found under "%LocalAppData%\M
icrosoft\WindowsApps\PythonSoftwareFoundation.PythonManager_3847v3x7pw
1km" or "%LocalAppData%\Microsoft\WindowsApps\PythonSoftwareFoundation
.PythonManager_qbz5n2kfra8p0", depending on whether it was installed
from python.org or through the Windows Store. Attempting to run the
executable directly from Program Files is not recommended.

To programmatically install the Python install manager, it is easiest
to use WinGet, which is included with all supported versions of
Windows:

   $> winget install 9NQ7512CXL7T -e --accept-package-agreements --disable-interactivity

   # Optionally run the configuration checker and accept all changes
   $> py install --configure -y

To download the Python install manager and install on another machine,
the following WinGet command will download the required files from the
Store to your Downloads directory (add "-d <location>" to customize
the output location). This also generates a YAML file that appears to
be unnecessary, as the downloaded MSIX can be installed by launching
or using the commands below.

   $> winget download 9NQ7512CXL7T -e --skip-license --accept-package-agreements --accept-source-agreements

To programmatically install or uninstall an MSIX using only
PowerShell, the Add-AppxPackage and Remove-AppxPackage PowerShell
cmdlets are recommended:

   $> Add-AppxPackage C:\Downloads\python-manager-25.0.msix
   ...
   $> Get-AppxPackage PythonSoftwareFoundation.PythonManager | Remove-AppxPackage

The latest release can be downloaded and installed by Windows by
passing the AppInstaller file to the Add-AppxPackage command. This
installs using the MSIX on python.org, and is only recommended for
cases where installing via the Store (interactively or using WinGet)
is not possible.

   $> Add-AppxPackage -AppInstallerFile https://www.python.org/ftp/python/pymanager/pymanager.appinstaller

Other tools and APIs may also be used to provision an MSIX package for
all users on a machine, but Python does not consider this a supported
scenario. We suggest looking into the PowerShell Add-
AppxProvisionedPackage cmdlet, the native Windows PackageManager
class, or the documentation and support for your deployment tool.

Regardless of the install method, users will still need to install
their own copies of Python itself, as there is no way to trigger those
installs without being a logged in user. When using the MSIX, the
latest version of Python will be available for all users to install
without network access.

Note that the MSIX downloadable from the Store and from the Python
website are subtly different and cannot be installed at the same time.
Wherever possible, we suggest using the above WinGet commands to
download the package from the Store to reduce the risk of setting up
conflicting installs. There are no licensing restrictions on the
Python install manager that would prevent using the Store package in
this way.


4.1.11. Administrative configuration
------------------------------------

There are a number of options that may be useful for administrators to
override configuration of the Python install manager. These can be
used to provide local caching, disable certain shortcut types,
override bundled content. All of the above configuration options may
be set, as well as those below.

Configuration options may be overridden in the registry by setting
values under "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Policies\Python\PyManager",
where the value name matches the configuration key and the value type
is "REG_SZ". Note that this key can itself be customized, but only by
modifying the core config file distributed with the Python install
manager. We recommend, however, that registry values are used only to
set "base_config" to a JSON file containing the full set of overrides.
Registry key overrides will replace any other configured setting,
while "base_config" allows users to further modify settings they may
need.

Note that most settings with environment variables support those
variables because their default setting specifies the variable. If you
override them, the environment variable will no longer work, unless
you override it with another one. For example, the default value of
"confirm" is literally "%PYTHON_MANAGER_CONFIRM%", which will resolve
the variable at load time. If you override the value to "yes", then
the environment variable will no longer be used. If you override the
value to "%CONFIRM%", then that environment variable will be used
instead.

Configuration settings that are paths are interpreted as relative to
the directory containing the configuration file that specified them.

4.1.12. Installing free-threaded binaries
-----------------------------------------

Added in version 3.13.

Pre-built distributions of the free-threaded build are available by
installing tags with the "t" suffix.

   $> py install 3.14t
   $> py install 3.14t-arm64
   $> py install 3.14t-32

This will install and register as normal. If you have no other
runtimes installed, then "python" will launch this one. Otherwise, you
will need to use "py -V:3.14t ..." or, if you have added the global
aliases directory to your "PATH" environment variable, the
"python3.14t.exe" commands.


4.1.13. Troubleshooting
-----------------------

If your Python install manager does not seem to be working correctly,
please work through these tests and fixes to see if it helps. If not,
please report an issue at our bug tracker, including any relevant log
files (written to your "%TEMP%" directory by default).

4.2. 내장 가능한 패키지
=======================

Added in version 3.5.

내장된 배포는 최소 파이썬 환경을 포함하는 ZIP 파일입니다. 최종 사용자
가 직접 액세스하기보다는, 다른 응용 프로그램의 일부로 작동하기 위한 것
입니다.

To install an embedded distribution, we recommend using "py install"
with the "--target" option:

   $> py install 3.14-embed --target=<directory>

When extracted, the embedded distribution is (almost) fully isolated
from the user's system, including environment variables, system
registry settings, and installed packages. The standard library is
included as pre-compiled and optimized ".pyc" files in a ZIP, and
"python3.dll", "python313.dll", "python.exe" and "pythonw.exe" are all
provided. Tcl/tk (including all dependents, such as Idle), pip and the
Python documentation are not included.

A default "._pth" file is included, which further restricts the
default search paths (as described below in 모듈 찾기). This file is
intended for embedders to modify as necessary.

제삼자 패키지는 내장된 배포와 함께 응용 프로그램 설치 프로그램이 설치
해야 합니다. 일반 파이썬 설치처럼 종속성을 관리하기 위해 pip를 사용하
는 것은 이 배포에서 지원되지 않지만, 주의를 기울이면 자동 업데이트를
위해 pip를 포함하고 사용할 수 있습니다. 일반적으로, 제삼자 패키지는 개
발자가 사용자에게 업데이트를 제공하기 전에 최신 버전과의 호환성을 보장
할 수 있도록 응용 프로그램의 일부로 처리되어야 합니다 ("벤더링
(vendoring)").

이 배포에 권장되는 두 가지 사용 사례가 아래에 설명되어 있습니다.


4.2.1. Python application
-------------------------

파이썬으로 작성된 응용 프로그램이 반드시 사용자가 그 사실을 인식하도록
할 필요는 없습니다. 이 경우 내장된 배포를 사용하여 설치 패키지에 파이
썬의 내부 버전을 포함할 수 있습니다. 얼마나 투명해야 하는지(또는 반대
로, 얼마나 전문적으로 보여야 하는지)에 따라, 두 가지 옵션이 있습니다.

특수 실행 파일을 런처로 사용하려면 약간의 코딩이 필요하지만, 사용자에
게 가장 투명한 경험을 제공합니다. 사용자 정의된 런처를 사용하면, 프로
그램이 파이썬에서 실행되고 있다는 명백한 표시가 없습니다: 아이콘을 사
용자 정의하고, 회사와 버전 정보를 지정할 수 있으며 파일 연결이 제대로
작동합니다. 대부분의 경우, 사용자 정의 런처는 하드 코딩된 명령 줄을 사
용하여 "Py_Main"을 호출할 수 있어야 합니다.

더 간단한 방법은 필요한 명령 줄 인자를 사용하여 "python.exe"나
"pythonw.exe"를 직접 호출하는 배치 파일이나 생성된 바로 가기를 제공하
는 것입니다. 이 경우, 응용 프로그램은 실제 이름이 아닌 파이썬으로 표시
되며, 사용자는 실행 중인 다른 파이썬 프로세스나 파일 연결과 구별하는
데 어려움을 겪을 수 있습니다.

후자의 접근 방식에서는, 패키지를 파이썬 실행 파일과 함께 디렉터리로 설
치하여 경로에서 사용할 수 있도록 해야 합니다. 특수 런처를 사용하면, 응
용 프로그램을 시작하기 전에 검색 경로를 지정할 수 있어서 패키지를 다른
위치에 배치할 수 있습니다.


4.2.2. 파이썬 내장하기
----------------------

네이티브 코드로 작성된 응용 프로그램에는 종종 어떤 형태의 스크립팅 언
어가 필요하며, 내장된 파이썬 배포를 이러한 목적으로 사용할 수 있습니다
. 일반적으로, 대부분의 응용 프로그램은 네이티브 코드로 되어 있으며, 일
부가 "python.exe"를 호출하거나 "python3.dll"을 직접 사용합니다. 두 경
우 모두, 내장된 배포를 응용 프로그램 설치의 하위 디렉터리로 추출하면
로드할 수 있는 파이썬 인터프리터를 제공하기에 충분합니다.

응용 프로그램 사용과 마찬가지로, 인터프리터를 초기화하기 전에 검색 경
로를 지정할 기회가 있어서 패키지를 임의의 위치에 설치할 수 있습니다.
그 외에는, 내장된 배포와 일반 설치를 사용하는 것 간에 근본적인 차이점
은 없습니다.


4.3. nuget.org 패키지
=====================

Added in version 3.5.2.

nuget.org 패키지는 시스템 전체에 파이썬이 설치되지 않은 지속적인 통합
과 빌드 시스템에 사용하기 위한 축소된 크기의 파이썬 환경입니다. 너겟은
".NET 용 패키지 관리자"이지만, 빌드 타임 도구가 포함된 패키지에서도 완
벽하게 작동합니다.

너겟 사용에 대한 최신 정보를 보려면 nuget.org를 방문하십시오. 다음은
파이썬 개발자에게 충분한 요약입니다.

"nuget.exe" 명령 줄 도구는, 예를 들어 curl이나 PowerShell을 사용하여
"https://aka.ms/nugetclidl"에서 직접 다운로드할 수 있습니다. 이 도구를
사용하면 다음과 같이 64비트나 32비트 컴퓨터용 파이썬의 최신 버전이 설
치됩니다:

   nuget.exe install python -ExcludeVersion -OutputDirectory .
   nuget.exe install pythonx86 -ExcludeVersion -OutputDirectory .

특정 버전을 선택하려면, "-Version 3.x.y"를 추가하십시오. 출력 디렉터리
는 "."에서 변경될 수 있으며, 패키지는 하위 디렉터리에 설치됩니다. 기본
적으로, 하위 디렉터리의 이름은 패키지와 같으며, "-ExcludeVersion" 옵션
이 없으면 이 이름에 설치된 특정 버전이 포함됩니다. 하위 디렉터리에는
파이썬 설치가 포함된 "tools" 디렉터리가 있습니다:

   # -ExcludeVersion 없이
   > .\python.3.5.2\tools\python.exe -V
   Python 3.5.2

   # -ExcludeVersion 포함
   > .\python\tools\python.exe -V
   Python 3.5.2

일반적으로, 너겟 패키지는 업그레이드할 수 없으며, 최신 버전을 나란히
설치하고 전체 경로를 사용하여 참조해야 합니다. 또는, 패키지 디렉터리를
수동으로 삭제하고 다시 설치하십시오. 많은 CI 시스템은 빌드 간에 파일을
보존하지 않으면 이 작업을 자동으로 수행합니다.

"tools" 디렉터리와 함께 "build\native" 디렉터리가 있습니다. 여기에는
파이썬 설치를 참조하기 위해 C++ 프로젝트에서 사용할 수 있는 MSBuild 속
성 파일 "python.props"가 포함되어 있습니다. 설정을 포함하면 빌드에서
자동으로 헤더와 임포트 라이브러리를 사용합니다.

nuget.org의 패키지 정보 페이지는 64비트 버전의 경우
www.nuget.org/packages/python, 32비트 버전의 경우
www.nuget.org/packages/pythonx86 그리고 ARM64 버전의 경우
www.nuget.org/packages/pythonarm64입니다.


4.3.1. 자유 스레드 패키지
-------------------------

Added in version 3.13.

Packages containing free-threaded binaries are named python-
freethreaded for the 64-bit version, pythonx86-freethreaded for the
32-bit version, and pythonarm64-freethreaded for the ARM64 version.
These packages contain both the "python3.13t.exe" and "python.exe"
entry points, both of which run free threaded.


4.4. 대체 번들
==============

표준 CPython 배포 외에도, 추가 기능을 포함하는 수정된 패키지가 있습니
다. 다음은 많이 사용되는 버전과 주요 기능 목록입니다:

ActivePython
   다중 플랫폼 호환성, 설명서, PyWin32가 있는 설치 프로그램

Anaconda
   인기 있는 과학 모듈(가령 numpy, scipy 및 pandas)과 "conda" 패키지
   관리자.

Enthought Deployment Manager
   "The Next Generation Python Environment and Package Manager".

   Previously Enthought provided Canopy, but it reached end of life in
   2016.

WinPython
   사전 빌드된 과학 패키지와 패키지 빌드를 위한 도구가 포함된 윈도우
   전용 배포.

이러한 패키지들은 최신 버전의 파이썬이나 기타 라이브러리를 포함하지 않
을 수 있으며, 핵심 파이썬 팀에서 유지 관리하거나 지원하지 않음에 유의
하십시오.


4.5. Supported Windows versions
===============================

As specified in **PEP 11**, a Python release only supports a Windows
platform while Microsoft considers the platform under extended
support. This means that Python 3.14 supports Windows 10 and newer. If
you require Windows 7 support, please install Python 3.8. If you
require Windows 8.1 support, please install Python 3.12.


4.6. Removing the MAX_PATH limitation
=====================================

윈도우는 역사적으로 경로 길이를 260자로 제한했습니다. 이는 이보다 긴
경로는 결정(resolve)되지 않고 에러가 발생함을 의미합니다.

In the latest versions of Windows, this limitation can be expanded to
over 32,000 characters. Your administrator will need to activate the
"Enable Win32 long paths" group policy, or set "LongPathsEnabled" to
"1" in the registry key
"HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem".

이는 "open()" 함수, "os" 모듈 및 대부분의 다른 경로 기능이 260자보다
긴 경로를 받아들이고 반환할 수 있도록 합니다.

After changing the above option and rebooting, no further
configuration is required.


4.7. UTF-8 모드
===============

Added in version 3.7.

윈도우는 여전히 시스템 인코딩에 레거시 인코딩을 사용합니다 (ANSI 코드
페이지). 파이썬은 이를 텍스트 파일의 기본 인코딩에 이를 사용합니다 (예
를 들어 "locale.getencoding()").

UTF-8은 인터넷과 WSL(Windows Subsystem for Linux)을 포함한 대부분의 유
닉스 시스템에서 널리 사용되기 때문에 문제가 발생할 수 있습니다.

파이썬 UTF-8 모드를 사용하여 기본 텍스트 인코딩을 UTF-8로 변경할 수 있
습니다. "-X utf8" 명령 줄 옵션이나 "PYTHONUTF8=1" 환경 변수를 통해 파
이썬 UTF-8 모드를 활성화할 수 있습니다. UTF-8 모드를 활성화하려면
"PYTHONUTF8"을, 환경 변수를 수정하는 방법은 Python install manager를
참조하십시오.

When the Python UTF-8 Mode is enabled, you can still use the system
encoding (the ANSI Code Page) via the "mbcs" codec.

기본 환경 변수에 "PYTHONUTF8=1"을 추가하면 시스템의 모든 파이썬 3.7+
응용 프로그램에 영향을 줍니다. 레거시 시스템 인코딩에 의존하는 파이썬
3.7+ 응용 프로그램이 있으면 환경 변수를 임시로 설정하거나 "-X utf8" 명
령 줄 옵션을 사용하는 것이 좋습니다.

참고:

  UTF-8 모드가 비활성화된 경우에도, 파이썬은 윈도우에서 기본적으로 다
  음을 위해 UTF-8을 사용합니다:

  * 표준 I/O를 포함한 콘솔 I/O (자세한 내용은 **PEP 528**을 참조하십시
    오).

  * *파일 시스템 인코딩* (자세한 내용은 **PEP 529**를 참조하십시오).


4.8. 모듈 찾기
==============

These notes supplement the description at The initialization of the
sys.path module search path with detailed Windows notes.

"._pth" 파일이 없을 때, 윈도우에서 "sys.path"를 채우는 방법은 다음과
같습니다:

* 시작에 현재 디렉터리에 해당하는 빈 항목이 추가됩니다.

* 환경 변수에 설명된 대로, 환경 변수 "PYTHONPATH"가 존재하면, 해당 항
  목이 다음에 추가됩니다. 윈도우에서, 이 변수의 경로는 드라이브 식별자
  ("C:\" 등)에 사용되는 콜론과 구별하기 위해 세미콜론으로 구분되어야
  합니다.

* 추가 "응용 프로그램 경로"는 "HKEY_CURRENT_USER"와
  "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE" 하이브 모두의 아래에
  "\SOFTWARE\Python\PythonCore{version}\PythonPath"의 하위 키로 레지스
  트리에 추가될 수 있습니다. 세미콜론으로 구분된 경로 문자열을 기본값
  으로 사용하는 하위 키는 각 경로가 "sys.path"에 추가되도록 합니다. (
  알려진 모든 설치 프로그램은 HKLM 만 사용하므로, HKCU는 일반적으로 비
  어 있음에 유의하십시오.)

* 환경 변수 "PYTHONHOME"이 설정되면, "파이썬 홈"으로 간주합니다. 그렇
  지 않으면, 메인 파이썬 실행 파일의 경로를 사용하여 "랜드마크 파일
  "("Lib\os.py"나 "pythonXY.zip")을 찾아 "파이썬 홈"을 추론합니다. 파
  이썬 홈이 발견되면, "sys.path"에 추가되는 관련 하위 디렉터리("Lib",
  "plat-win" 등)는 해당 폴더를 기반으로 합니다. 그렇지 않으면, 핵심 파
  이썬 경로가 레지스트리에 저장된 PythonPath에서 구성됩니다.

* 파이썬 홈을 찾을 수 없고, 환경에 "PYTHONPATH"가 지정되어 있지 않고,
  레지스트리 항목을 찾을 수 없으면, 상대 항목의 기본 경로(예를 들어
  ".\Lib;.\plat-win" 등)가 사용됩니다.

"pyvenv.cfg" 파일이 메인 실행 파일과 함께 또는 실행 파일보다 한 수준
위의 디렉터리에서 발견되면, 다음 변형이 적용됩니다:

* "home"이 절대 경로이고 "PYTHONHOME"이 설정되지 않으면, 홈 위치를 추
  론할 때 메인 실행 파일에 대한 경로 대신 이 경로가 사용됩니다.

이 모든 것의 최종 결과는 다음과 같습니다:

* "python.exe" 또는 기본 파이썬 디렉터리 (설치된 버전 또는 PCbuild 디
  렉터리에서 직접)에서 다른 .exe를 실행할 때 핵심 경로가 추론되고 레지
  스트리의 핵심 경로가 무시됩니다. 레지스트리의 다른 "응용 프로그램 경
  로"는 항상 읽습니다.

* 파이썬이 다른 .exe(다른 디렉터리, COM을 통한 내장, 등)에서 호스팅 될
  때, "파이썬 홈"이 추론되지 않아서, 레지스트리의 핵심 경로가 사용됩니
  다. 레지스트리의 다른 "응용 프로그램 경로"는 항상 읽힙니다.

* 파이썬이 홈을 찾을 수 없고 레지스트리 값이 없으면 (고정된(frozen)
  .exe, 아주 이상한 설치 설정), 일부 기본 (하지만 상대) 경로를 얻게 됩
  니다.

파이썬을 응용 프로그램이나 배포에 번들로 포함하려는 사용자를 위해, 다
음 조언은 다른 설치와의 충돌을 방지합니다:

* 포함할 디렉터리가 포함된 실행 파일과 함께 "._pth" 파일을 포함합니다.
  이것은 레지스트리와 환경 변수에 나열된 경로를 무시하고, "import
  site"가 나열되지 않는 한 "site"도 무시합니다.

* 여러분 자신의 실행 파일에서 "python3.dll"이나 "python37.dll"을 로드
  하면, "Py_InitializeFromConfig()" 전에
  "PyConfig.module_search_paths" 를 명시적으로 설정하십시오.

* 응용 프로그램에서 "python.exe"를 시작하기 전에 "PYTHONPATH"를 지우거
  나 덮어쓰고 "PYTHONHOME"를 설정하십시오.

* 이전 제안을 사용할 수 없으면 (예를 들어, 사용자가 "python.exe"를 직
  접 실행할 수 있는 배포판이면), 랜드마크 파일("Lib\os.py")이 설치 디
  렉터리에 있도록 하십시오. (ZIP 파일 내에서는 감지되지 않지만, 대신
  올바른 이름의 ZIP 파일은 감지됨에 유의하십시오.)

이렇게 하면 시스템 전체 설치의 파일이 응용 프로그램과 함께 번들로 제공
되는 표준 라이브러리의 복사본보다 우선하지 않습니다. 그렇지 않으면, 사
용자가 여러분의 응용 프로그램을 사용하는 데 문제가 발생할 수 있습니다.
다른 제안은 레지스트리의 비표준 경로와 사용자 site-packages에 여전히
취약할 수 있어서, 첫 번째 제안이 가장 좋음에 유의하십시오.

버전 3.6에서 변경: "._pth" 파일 지원을 추가하고 "pyvenv.cfg"에서
"applocal" 옵션을 제거합니다.

버전 3.6에서 변경: 실행 파일에 직접 인접할 때 잠재적인 랜드마크로
"python*XX*.zip"을 추가합니다.

버전 3.6부터 폐지됨: "Modules"("PythonPath"가 아닙니다) 아래의 레지스
트리에 지정된 모듈은 "importlib.machinery.WindowsRegistryFinder" 로 임
포트 할 수 있습니다. 이 파인더는 윈도우 3.6.0과 이전 버전에서 활성화되
지만, 향후에는 "sys.meta_path"에 명시적으로 추가해야 할 수도 있습니다.


4.9. 추가 모듈
==============

파이썬이 모든 플랫폼 간에 이식성 있는 것을 목표로 하지만, 윈도우에만
고유한 기능이 있습니다. 이러한 기능을 사용하기 위한 표준 라이브러리와
외부에 있는 두 개의 모듈과 스니펫(snippets)이 존재합니다.

윈도우 특정 표준 모듈은 MS 윈도우 특정 서비스에 설명되어 있습니다.


4.9.1. PyWin32
--------------

Mark Hammond의 PyWin32 모듈은 고급 윈도우 특정 지원을 위한 모듈 모음입
니다. 여기에는 다음을 위한 유틸리티가 포함됩니다:

* Component Object Model (COM)

* Win32 API 호출

* 레지스트리

* 이벤트 로그

* Microsoft Foundation Classes (MFC) 사용자 인터페이스

PythonWin은 PyWin32와 함께 제공되는 샘플 MFC 응용 프로그램입니다. 디버
거가 내장된 내장할 수 있는 IDE입니다.

  Python and COM
     저자: David와 Paul Boddie


4.9.2. cx_Freeze
----------------

cx_Freeze는 파이썬 스크립트를 실행 가능한 윈도우 프로그램("***.exe" 파
일)으로 래핑합니다. 이렇게 하면, 사용자가 파이썬을 설치할 필요 없는 응
용 프로그램을 배포할 수 있습니다.


4.10. 윈도우에서 파이썬 컴파일하기
==================================

CPython을 직접 컴파일하려면, 먼저 소스를 가져와야 합니다. 최신 릴리스
의 소스를 다운로드하거나 최신 버전을 체크아웃할 수 있습니다.

소스 트리에는 공식 파이썬 릴리스를 빌드하는 데 사용되는 컴파일러인
Microsoft Visual Studio 용 빌드 솔루션과 프로젝트 파일이 포함되어 있습
니다. 이 파일들은 "PCbuild" 디렉터리에 있습니다.

빌드 프로세스에 대한 일반 정보는 "PCbuild/readme.txt"를 확인하십시오.

확장 모듈에 대해서는, 윈도우에서 C와 C++ 확장 빌드하기를 참조하십시오.


4.11. The full installer (deprecated)
=====================================

버전 3.14부터 폐지됨: This installer is deprecated since 3.14 and will
not be produced for Python 3.16 or later. See Python install manager
for the modern installer.


4.11.1. 설치 단계
-----------------

네 개의 파이썬 3.14 설치 프로그램을 다운로드할 수 있습니다 - 각각 32비
트와 64비트 버전의 인터프리터를 지원하는 두 가지. *웹 설치 프로그램
(web installer)*은 작은 초기 다운로드이며, 필요한 구성 요소를 자동으로
다운로드합니다. *오프라인 설치 프로그램(offline installer)*에는 기본
설치에 필요한 구성 요소가 포함되어 있으며 선택적 기능을 위해서만 인터
넷 연결이 필요합니다. 설치 중 다운로드를 피하는 다른 방법은 Installing
without downloading를 참조하십시오.

설치 프로그램을 시작한 후, 두 가지 옵션 중 하나를 선택할 수 있습니다:

[그림]

"Install Now"를 선택하면:

* 관리자(administrator)일 필요는 *없습니다* (C 런타임 라이브러리에 대
  한 시스템 업데이트가 필요하거나 모든 사용자를 위해 Python install
  manager를 설치하지 않는 한)

* 파이썬이 사용자 디렉터리에 설치됩니다

* Python install manager는 첫 페이지 하단의 옵션에 따라 설치됩니다

* 표준 라이브러리, 테스트 스위트, 런처 및 pip가 설치됩니다

* 선택하면, 설치 디렉터리가 "PATH"에 추가됩니다

* 바로 가기는 현재 사용자에게만 표시됩니다

"Customize installation"을 선택하면 설치할 기능, 설치 위치 및 다른 옵
션이나 설치 후 작업을 선택할 수 있습니다. 디버깅 심볼이나 바이너리를
설치하려면, 이 옵션을 사용해야 합니다.

모든 사용자 설치를 수행하려면, "Customize installation"을 선택해야 합
니다. 이 경우:

* 관리자 자격 증명이나 승인을 제공해야 할 수 있습니다.

* 파이썬은 Program Files 디렉터리에 설치됩니다

* Python install manager는 Windows 디렉터리에 설치됩니다

* 설치 중에 선택적 기능을 선택할 수 있습니다

* 표준 라이브러리는 바이트 코드로 사전 컴파일될 수 있습니다

* 선택하면, 설치 디렉터리가 시스템 "PATH"에 추가됩니다

* 모든 사용자가 바로 가기를 사용할 수 있습니다


4.11.2. Removing the MAX_PATH limitation
----------------------------------------

윈도우는 역사적으로 경로 길이를 260자로 제한했습니다. 이는 이보다 긴
경로는 결정(resolve)되지 않고 에러가 발생함을 의미합니다.

최신 버전의 윈도우에서는, 이 제한을 약 32,000자로 확장할 수 있습니다.
관리자는 "Enable Win32 long paths" 그룹 정책을 활성화하거나, 레지스트
리 키 "HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem"
에서 "LongPathsEnabled"를 "1"로 설정해야 합니다.

이는 "open()" 함수, "os" 모듈 및 대부분의 다른 경로 기능이 260자보다
긴 경로를 받아들이고 반환할 수 있도록 합니다.

위 옵션을 변경한 후에는, 추가 구성이 필요하지 않습니다.

버전 3.6에서 변경: 긴 경로에 대한 지원이 파이썬에서 활성화되었습니다.


4.11.3. Installing without UI
-----------------------------

설치 프로그램 UI에서 사용할 수 있는 모든 옵션은 명령 줄에서도 지정할
수 있어서, 스크립팅 된 설치 프로그램이 사용자 상호 작용 없이 여러 컴퓨
터에서 설치를 복제할 수 있도록 합니다. 이러한 옵션은 일부 기본값을 변
경하기 위해 UI를 억제하지 않고 설정할 수도 있습니다.

The following options (found by executing the installer with "/?") can
be passed into the installer:

+-----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+
| 이름                  | 설명                                                     |
|=======================|==========================================================|

| /log [파일명]         | to specify log files location                            |
+-----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------+

다른 모든 옵션은 "name=value"로 전달됩니다. 여기서 value는 일반적으로
기능을 비활성화하려면 "0", 기능을 활성화하려면 "1" 또는 경로입니다. 사
용 가능한 옵션의 전체 목록은 다음과 같습니다.

4.11.4. Installing without downloading
--------------------------------------

파이썬의 일부 기능은 초기 설치 프로그램 다운로드에 포함되어 있지 않아
서, 이러한 기능을 선택하면 인터넷 연결이 필요할 수 있습니다. 이러한 요
구를 피하고자, 필요에 따라 모든 가능한 구성 요소를 내려받아 선택한 기
능과 관계없이 더는 인터넷 연결이 필요하지 않은 완전한 *레이아웃*을 만
들 수 있습니다. 이 다운로드는 필요한 것보다 클 수 있지만, 많은 수의 설
치를 수행할 경우 로컬로 캐시 된 사본을 보유하는 것이 매우 유용합니다.

가능한 모든 파일을 다운로드하려면 명령 프롬프트에서 다음 명령을 실행하
십시오. "python-3.9.0.exe"를 설치 프로그램의 실제 이름으로 대체하고,
같은 이름을 가진 파일 간의 충돌을 방지하기 위해 자체 디렉터리에 레이아
웃을 만들어야 합니다.

   python-3.9.0.exe /layout [선택적 대상 디렉터리]

"/quiet" 옵션을 지정하여 진행률 표시를 숨길 수도 있습니다.


4.11.5. 설치 수정하기
---------------------

일단 파이썬이 설치되면, 윈도우의 일부인 Programs and Features 도구를
통해 기능을 추가하거나 제거할 수 있습니다. Python 항목을 선택하고
"Uninstall/Change"를 선택하여 유지 관리 모드로 설치 프로그램을 엽니다.

"Modify"는 체크 박스를 수정하여 기능을 추가하거나 제거하도록 합니다 -
변경되지 않은 체크 박스는 아무것도 설치하거나 제거하지 않습니다. 이 모
드에서는 설치 디렉터리와 같은 일부 옵션을 변경할 수 없습니다; 이를 수
정하려면 파이썬을 완전히 제거한 다음 다시 설치해야 합니다.

"Repair"는 현재 설정을 사용하여 설치되어야 하는 모든 파일을 확인하고
제거되거나 수정된 파일을 대체합니다.

"Uninstall"은 파이썬을 완전히 제거하는데, Programs and Features에 자체
항목이 있는 Python install manager는 제외합니다.


4.11.6. Installing free-threaded binaries
-----------------------------------------

Added in version 3.13.

To install pre-built binaries with free-threading enabled (see **PEP
703**), you should select "Customize installation". The second page of
options includes the "Download free-threaded binaries" checkbox.

[그림]

Selecting this option will download and install additional binaries to
the same location as the main Python install. The main executable is
called "python3.13t.exe", and other binaries either receive a "t"
suffix or a full ABI suffix. Python source files and bundled third-
party dependencies are shared with the main install.

The free-threaded version is registered as a regular Python install
with the tag "3.13t" (with a "-32" or "-arm64" suffix as normal for
those platforms). This allows tools to discover it, and for the Python
install manager to support "py.exe -3.13t". Note that the launcher
will interpret "py.exe -3" (or a "python3" shebang) as "the latest 3.x
install", which will prefer the free-threaded binaries over the
regular ones, while "py.exe -3.13" will not. If you use the short
style of option, you may prefer to not install the free-threaded
binaries at this time.

To specify the install option at the command line, use
"Include_freethreaded=1". See Installing without downloading for
instructions on pre-emptively downloading the additional binaries for
offline install. The options to include debug symbols and binaries
also apply to the free-threaded builds.

Free-threaded binaries are also available on nuget.org.


4.12. Python launcher for Windows (deprecated)
==============================================

버전 3.14부터 폐지됨: The launcher and this documentation have been
superseded by the Python Install Manager described above. This is
preserved temporarily for historical interest.

Added in version 3.3.

윈도우 용 파이썬 런처는 다양한 파이썬 버전을 찾고 실행하는 데 도움이
되는 유틸리티입니다. 스크립트(또는 명령 줄)가 특정 파이썬 버전에 대한
선호를 나타내도록 허용하고, 해당 버전을 찾아 실행합니다.

"PATH" 변수와 달리, 런처는 가장 적합한 파이썬 버전을 올바르게 선택합니
다. 시스템 전체 설치보다 사용자별 설치를 선호하며, 가장 최근에 설치된
버전을 사용하기보다 언어 버전별로 순서를 매깁니다.

런처는 원래 **PEP 397**에서 지정되었습니다.


4.12.1. 시작하기
----------------


4.12.1.1. 명령 줄에서
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

버전 3.6에서 변경.

시스템 전체에 파이썬 3.3 이상을 설치하면 "PATH"에 런처를 넣습니다. 런
처는 사용 가능한 모든 파이썬 버전과 호환되므로, 어떤 버전이 설치되어
있는지는 중요하지 않습니다. 런처를 사용할 수 있는지 확인하려면, 명령
프롬프트에서 다음 명령을 실행하십시오:

   py

설치한 최신 버전의 파이썬이 시작되어야 합니다 - 정상적으로 종료할 수
있으며, 지정된 추가 명령 줄 인자가 파이썬으로 직접 전송됩니다.

여러 버전의 파이썬이 설치되어있으면 (예를 들어, 3.7과 3.14) 파이썬
3.14 시작되는 것을 알 수 있을 겁니다 - 파이썬 3.7을 시작하려면, 다음
명령을 시도하십시오:

   py -3.7

설치한 파이썬 2의 최신 버전을 원하면, 다음 명령을 시도하십시오:

   py -2

다음 에러가 표시되면, 런처가 설치되지 않은 것입니다:

   'py' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
   operable program or batch file.

명령:

   py --list

displays the currently installed version(s) of Python.

The "-x.y" argument is the short form of the "-V:Company/Tag"
argument, which allows selecting a specific Python runtime, including
those that may have come from somewhere other than python.org. Any
runtime registered by following **PEP 514** will be discoverable. The
"--list" command lists all available runtimes using the "-V:" format.

When using the "-V:" argument, specifying the Company will limit
selection to runtimes from that provider, while specifying only the
Tag will select from all providers. Note that omitting the slash
implies a tag:

   # '3.*' 태그가 지정된 런타임을 선택합니다
   py -V:3

   # 'PythonCore' 에서 출시된 런타임을 선택합니다
   py -V:PythonCore/

   # PythonCore 의 최신 파이썬 3 런타임을 선택합니다
   py -V:PythonCore/3

The short form of the argument ("-3") only ever selects from core
Python releases, and not other distributions. However, the longer form
("-V:3") will select from any.

The Company is matched on the full string, case-insensitive. The Tag
is matched on either the full string, or a prefix, provided the next
character is a dot or a hyphen. This allows "-V:3.1" to match
"3.1-32", but not "3.10". Tags are sorted using numerical ordering
("3.10" is newer than "3.1"), but are compared using text ("-V:3.01"
does not match "3.1").


4.12.1.2. 가상 환경
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Added in version 3.5.

런처가 명시적인 파이썬 버전 지정 없이 실행되고, 가상 환경(표준 라이브
러리 "venv" 모듈이나 외부 "virtualenv" 도구로 생성된)이 활성화되었으면
, 런처는 전역 인터프리터가 아닌 가상 환경의 인터프리터를 실행합니다.
전역 인터프리터를 실행하려면 가상 환경을 비활성화하거나, 전역 파이썬
버전을 명시적으로 지정하십시오.


4.12.1.3. 스크립트에서
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

테스트 파이썬 스크립트를 만들어 봅시다 - 다음 내용으로 "hello.py"라는
파일을 만듭니다.

   #! python
   import sys
   sys.stdout.write("hello from Python %s\n" % (sys.version,))

hello.py가 있는 디렉터리에서, 다음 명령을 실행합니다:

   py hello.py

최신 파이썬 2.x 설치의 버전 번호가 인쇄됨을 알 수 있습니다. 이제 첫 번
째 줄을 다음과 같이 변경합니다:

   #! python3

명령을 다시 실행하면 이제 최신 파이썬 3.x 정보가 인쇄됩니다. 위의 명령
줄 예제와 마찬가지로, 더 명시적인 버전 한정자를 지정할 수 있습니다. 파
이썬 3.7이 설치되어 있다고 가정하고, 첫 번째 줄을 "#! python3.7"으로
변경하면 3.7 버전 정보가 인쇄됩니다.

대화 형 사용과 달리, 장식 없는 "python"은 설치된 파이썬 2.x의 최신 버
전을 사용합니다. 이는 이전 버전과의 호환성과 유닉스와의 호환성을 위한
것입니다, 여기서 "python" 명령은 일반적으로 파이썬 2를 참조합니다.


4.12.1.4. 파일 연결에서
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

런처는 설치 시 파이썬 파일(즉 ".py", ".pyw", ".pyc" 파일)과 연결되어
있어야 합니다. 즉, 윈도우 탐색기에서 이러한 파일 중 하나를 더블 클릭하
면 런처가 사용되므로, 위에서 설명한 것과 같은 기능을 사용하여 스크립트
에서 사용해야 하는 버전을 지정할 수 있습니다.

이것의 주요 이점은 첫 번째 줄의 내용에 따라 단일 런처가 동시에 여러 파
이썬 버전을 지원할 수 있다는 것입니다.


4.12.2. Shebang lines
---------------------

스크립트 파일의 첫 번째 줄이 "#!"로 시작하면 "셔뱅(shebang)"줄이라고
합니다. 리눅스와 기타 유닉스 류 운영 체제는 이러한 줄을 기본적으로 지
원하며 스크립트 실행 방법을 나타내기 위해 이러한 시스템에서 일반적으로
사용됩니다. 이 런처를 사용하면 윈도우에서 파이썬 스크립트로 같은 기능
을 사용할 수 있으며 위의 예제는 그 사용법을 보여줍니다.

파이썬 스크립트의 셔뱅 줄을 유닉스와 윈도우 간에 이식성 있도록 하기 위
해, 이 런처는 사용할 인터프리터를 지정하는 여러 '가상' 명령을 지원합니
다. 지원되는 가상 명령은 다음과 같습니다:

* "/usr/bin/env"

* "/usr/bin/python"

* "/usr/local/bin/python"

* "python"

예를 들어, 스크립트의 첫 번째 줄이 다음과 같이 시작하면

   #! /usr/bin/python

기본 파이썬이나 활성 가상 환경을 찾아서 사용합니다. 유닉스에서 작동하
도록 작성된 많은 파이썬 스크립트에는 이미 이 줄이 있어서, 수정하지 않
고도 이러한 스크립트를 런처에서 사용할 수 있습니다. 윈도우에서 유닉스
에서 유용할 새 스크립트를 작성하면, "/usr"로 시작하는 셔뱅 줄 중 하나
를 사용해야 합니다.

위의 모든 가상 명령은 명시적 버전(주 버전 만 또는 주 버전과 부 버전)으
로 접미사를 붙일 수 있습니다. 또한 부 버전 뒤에 "-32"를 추가하여 32비
트 버전을 요청할 수 있습니다. 즉 "/usr/bin/python3.7-32"는 32비트 파이
썬 3.7의 사용을 요청합니다. 가상 환경이 활성화되어 있다면, 버전은 무시
되고 환경이 사용됩니다.

Added in version 3.7: 파이썬 런처 3.7부터는 "-64" 접미사로 64비트 버전
을 요청할 수 있습니다. 또한 부 버전 없이 주 버전과 아키텍처를 지정할
수 있습니다 (즉 "/usr/bin/python3-64").

버전 3.11에서 변경: The "-64" suffix is deprecated, and now implies
"any architecture that is not provably i386/32-bit". To request a
specific environment, use the new "-V:*TAG*" argument with the
complete tag.

버전 3.13에서 변경: Virtual commands referencing "python" now prefer
an active virtual environment rather than searching "PATH". This
handles cases where the shebang specifies "/usr/bin/env python3" but
"python3.exe" is not present in the active environment.

The "/usr/bin/env" form of shebang line has one further special
property. Before looking for installed Python interpreters, this form
will search the executable "PATH" for a Python executable matching the
name provided as the first argument. This corresponds to the behaviour
of the Unix "env" program, which performs a "PATH" search. If an
executable matching the first argument after the "env" command cannot
be found, but the argument starts with "python", it will be handled as
described for the other virtual commands. The environment variable
"PYLAUNCHER_NO_SEARCH_PATH" may be set (to any value) to skip this
search of "PATH".

Shebang lines that do not match any of these patterns are looked up in
the "[commands]" section of the launcher's .INI file. This may be used
to handle certain commands in a way that makes sense for your system.
The name of the command must be a single argument (no spaces in the
shebang executable), and the value substituted is the full path to the
executable (additional arguments specified in the .INI will be quoted
as part of the filename).

   [commands]
   /bin/xpython=C:\Program Files\XPython\python.exe

Any commands not found in the .INI file are treated as **Windows**
executable paths that are absolute or relative to the directory
containing the script file. This is a convenience for Windows-only
scripts, such as those generated by an installer, since the behavior
is not compatible with Unix-style shells. These paths may be quoted,
and may include multiple arguments, after which the path to the script
and any additional arguments will be appended.


4.12.3. 셔뱅 줄의 인자
----------------------

셔뱅 줄은 또한 파이썬 인터프리터에 전달할 추가 옵션을 지정할 수 있습니
다. 예를 들어, 다음과 같은 셔뱅 줄이 있으면:

   #! /usr/bin/python -v

파이썬은 "-v" 옵션으로 시작됩니다


4.12.4. 사용자 정의
-------------------


4.12.4.1. INI 파일을 통한 사용자 정의
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

런처는 두 개의 .ini 파일을 검색합니다 - 현재 사용자의 응용프로그램 데
이터 디렉터리("%LOCALAPPDATA%"나 "$env:LocalAppData")에 있는 "py.ini"
와 런처와 같은 디렉터리에 있는 "py.ini". 런처의 '콘솔' 버전(즉 py.exe)
과 '윈도우' 버전(즉 pyw.exe) 모두에 같은 .ini 파일이 사용됩니다.

"응용 프로그램 디렉터리"에 지정된 사용자 정의가 실행 파일 옆에 있는 사
용자 지정보다 우선하므로, 런처 옆에 있는 .ini 파일에 대한 쓰기 권한이
없는 사용자는 전역 .ini 파일에서 명령을 재정의할 수 있습니다.


4.12.4.2. 기본 파이썬 버전 사용자 정의
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

때에 따라, 버전 한정자를 명령에 포함하여 명령에서 사용할 파이썬 버전을
지정할 수 있습니다. 버전 한정자는 주 버전 번호로 시작하며 선택적으로
마침표('.')와 부 버전 지정자가 올 수 있습니다. 또한 "-32"나 "-64"를 추
가하여 32비트나 64비트 구현을 요청할지를 지정할 수 있습니다.

예를 들어, "#!python"의 셔뱅 줄에는 버전 한정자가 없는 반면,
"#!python3"에는 주 버전 만 지정하는 버전 한정자가 있습니다.

If no version qualifiers are found in a command, the environment
variable "PY_PYTHON" can be set to specify the default version
qualifier. If it is not set, the default is "3". The variable can
specify any value that may be passed on the command line, such as "3",
"3.7", "3.7-32" or "3.7-64". (Note that the "-64" option is only
available with the launcher included with Python 3.7 or newer.)

부 버전 한정자가 없으면, 환경 변수 "PY_PYTHON{major}"(여기서 "{major}"
는 위에서 결정된 현재 주 버전 한정자입니다)를 설정하여 전체 버전을 지
정할 수 있습니다. 그러한 옵션이 없으면, 런처는 설치된 파이썬 버전을 열
거하고 주 버전에 대해 발견된 최신 부 릴리스를 사용합니다. 이것은 보장
되지는 않지만, 해당 제품군에서 가장 최근에 설치된 버전일 가능성이 높습
니다.

같은 (major.minor) 파이썬 버전의 32비트와 64비트 구현이 모두 설치된 64
비트 윈도우에서는 항상 64비트 버전이 선호됩니다. 이는 32비트와 64비트
런처 구현 모두에 해당합니다 - 32비트 런처는 가능하면 지정된 버전의 64
비트 파이썬 설치를 실행하는 것을 선호합니다. 따라서 런처의 동작은 PC에
설치된 버전만 알고 설치 순서와 관계없이 (즉, 32비트나 64비트 버전의 파
이썬과 해당 런처가 마지막에 설치되었는지 알지 못하고) 예측할 수 있습니
다). 위에서 언급했듯이, 선택적 "-32"나 "-64" 접미사를 버전 지정자에 사
용하여 이 동작을 변경할 수 있습니다.

예:

* 관련 옵션이 설정되지 않으면, "python"과 "python2" 명령은 설치된 최신
  파이썬 2.x 버전을 사용하고 "python3" 명령은 설치된 최신 파이썬 3.x를
  사용합니다.

* "python3.7" 명령은 버전이 완전히 지정되어 있어서 옵션을 전혀 참조하
  지 않습니다.

* "PY_PYTHON=3"이면, "python"과 "python3" 명령은 모두 최신 설치된 파이
  썬 3 버전을 사용합니다.

* "PY_PYTHON=3.7-32"이면, "python" 명령은 3.7의 32비트 구현을 사용하는
  반면 "python3" 명령은 가장 최근에 설치된 파이썬을 사용합니다 (주 버
  전이 지정되었기 때문에 PY_PYTHON은 전혀 고려되지 않았습니다).

* "PY_PYTHON=3"이고 "PY_PYTHON3=3.7"이면, "python"과 "python3" 명령은
  모두 구체적으로 3.7을 사용합니다.

환경 변수 외에도, 런처에서 사용하는 .INI 파일에서 같은 설정을 구성할
수 있습니다. INI 파일의 섹션은 "[defaults]"라고 하며 키 이름은 선행
"PY_" 접두어가 없는 환경 변수와 같습니다 (그리고 INI 파일의 키 이름은
대소 문자를 구분하지 않음에 유의하십시오.) 환경 변수의 내용은 INI 파일
에 지정된 것을 재정의합니다.

예를 들면:

* "PY_PYTHON=3.7"을 설정하는 것은 다음을 포함하는 INI 파일과 동등합니
  다:

   [defaults]
   python=3.7

* "PY_PYTHON=3"과 "PY_PYTHON3=3.7"을 설정하는 것은 다음을 포함하는 INI
  파일과 동등합니다:

   [defaults]
   python=3
   python3=3.7


4.12.5. 진단
------------

If an environment variable "PYLAUNCHER_DEBUG" is set (to any value),
the launcher will print diagnostic information to stderr (i.e. to the
console). While this information manages to be simultaneously verbose
*and* terse, it should allow you to see what versions of Python were
located, why a particular version was chosen and the exact command-
line used to execute the target Python. It is primarily intended for
testing and debugging.


4.12.6. Dry run
---------------

If an environment variable "PYLAUNCHER_DRYRUN" is set (to any value),
the launcher will output the command it would have run, but will not
actually launch Python. This may be useful for tools that want to use
the launcher to detect and then launch Python directly. Note that the
command written to standard output is always encoded using UTF-8, and
may not render correctly in the console.


4.12.7. 필요 시 설치
--------------------

If an environment variable "PYLAUNCHER_ALLOW_INSTALL" is set (to any
value), and the requested Python version is not installed but is
available on the Microsoft Store, the launcher will attempt to install
it. This may require user interaction to complete, and you may need to
run the command again.

An additional "PYLAUNCHER_ALWAYS_INSTALL" variable causes the launcher
to always try to install Python, even if it is detected. This is
mainly intended for testing (and should be used with
"PYLAUNCHER_DRYRUN").


4.12.8. Return codes
--------------------

The following exit codes may be returned by the Python launcher.
Unfortunately, there is no way to distinguish these from the exit code
of Python itself.

The names of codes are as used in the sources, and are only for
reference. There is no way to access or resolve them apart from
reading this page. Entries are listed in alphabetical order of names.
